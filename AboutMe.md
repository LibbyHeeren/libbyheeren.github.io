# About Me

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, and... personal financial planning. No, really! My husband and I love living as debt-free as possible, and I enjoy helping others reach their personal and financial goals, too. Nothing feels better to me than watching someone accomplish something they never thought they could. I'm an avid craftsperson, whether that's sewing my own clothes, knitting sweaters, or building furniture, and I have had a lifelong love affair with baking.  

Some of my other hobbies include watercolor painting, video games, animal rescue, and [portrait photography](https://libbyheeren.smugmug.com/Portfolio).  

Here are a few fun little watercolors:

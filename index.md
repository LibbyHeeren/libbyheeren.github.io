## Hi, I'm Libby  

![Image](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-nCKV6FZ/0/074728eb/L/i-nCKV6FZ-L.jpg)  

I'm a graduate of The University of Texas at San Antonio where I earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Science and a Master of Science in Data Analytics. If Management Science sounds like a weird degree, that's because it's a little uncommon. It's a field that focuses on the application of scientific and mathematical modeling to aid in organizational decision making. Math, statistics, and programming applied to solving business problems? That's my jam! Think data mining, operations research, and decision science. I went back to school after spending too many years in meetings trying to figure out how I could get into the engineering department so **I** could build cool models, too.   



The links below will take you to some of the assignments I've completed in my masters program. If you have any questions, please feel free to [email me](mailto:libbyheeren@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethheeren/). I'd love to talk to you. Thanks for stopping by!

And, if you're interested, here's a little bit more [**About Me**](AboutMe.md)  


### Predictive and Inferential Modeling Assignments  

[**Predicting Customer Receptivity in R**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/DAapps1/) - Report not included for privacy. This was a group project in which writing tasks were shared.   

[**Simple Neural Network in Python**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/SimpleNN/)  

[**Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/CNN/)  

### Personal Interest Project from my Independent Study in NLP  

[**Study of Gender Power and Submissiveness in The Wheel of Time books, in Python**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/WoT_NLP/) - This is a fun, messy python notebook full of exploration and learning. If you'd like to see my small final report, you can find it [**here!**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fo3mMlpP2YSdHKxcOrp6ycL0D1i42Nhi/view?usp=sharing)    


### Exploratory Analysis and Visualization Assignments  

[**Data Manipulation using dplyr in R**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/DataViz0/)  

[**Data Cleaning and Prediction in Python**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/BigData2/)  

[**Data Exploration using ggplot2 in R**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/DataViz1/) - This assignment had us recreate visualizations using ggplot2 with no other information except a data set and a picture of the final output.    

[**Interactive Data Visualization using plotly and highcharter in R**](https://libbyheeren.github.io/DataViz2/)  

[**Shiny App Example**](https://libbyheeren.shinyapps.io/dv_hw3/) which requires you to download [**this SAS dataset as input**](https://github.com/LibbyHeeren/DataViz3/raw/main/AAPL.sas7bdat) first.    

[**Risky Restaurants Visualized in Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/libby.heeren#!/vizhome/Heeren_NUC203_Homework4/MapofRiskyRestaurants) - hosted on Tableau Public. This was a quick assignment that didn't delve into Tableau much at all. My main focus has been visualization in R, mainly using ggplot2. However, I'm pursuing certification in Tableau and hope to explore all it has to offer. I've also had experience using Domo Dashboards, and would be open to certifying in Domo as well!

## Hi, I'm Libby  

![Image](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-nCKV6FZ/0/074728eb/L/i-nCKV6FZ-L.jpg)  

I'm a graduate of The University of Texas at San Antonio where I earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Science and a Master of Science in Data Analytics. If Management Science sounds like a weird degree, that's because it's a little uncommon. It's a field that focuses on the application of scientific and mathematical modeling to aid in organizational decision making. Math, statistics, and programming applied to solving business problems? That's my jam! Think data mining, operations research, and decision science. I went back to school after spending too many years in meetings trying to figure out how I could get into the engineering department so **I** could build cool models, too.   



The links below will take you to some of the assignments I've completed in my masters program. If you have any questions, please feel free to [email me](mailto:libbyheeren@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethheeren/). I'd love to talk to you. Thanks for stopping by!

And, if you're interested, here's a little bit more [About Me](AboutMe.md)
